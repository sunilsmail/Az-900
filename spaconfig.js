Exposing a Micro Frontend (MFE) and importing it into a shell application using **Single-SPA** involves configuring both the micro frontend and the root or shell application. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you through the process.

### Steps to Expose a Micro Frontend and Import It in a Shell Application

---

### 1. **Expose the Micro Frontend (MFE)**

In your micro frontend application, you need to configure it to be exposed so that it can be imported by the shell application.

#### Example: Exposing a Micro Frontend with CRACO

Assuming you have already set up a React micro frontend using **CRACO**, you can expose it by modifying the `craco.config.js` file and the entry point files.

1. **Modify `craco.config.js`** to set `libraryTarget` to `system`:

   ```javascript
   // craco.config.js
   module.exports = {
     webpack: {
       configure: (webpackConfig) => {
         webpackConfig.output = {
           ...webpackConfig.output,
           libraryTarget: 'system', // Important for Single-SPA
           filename: 'static/js/[name].js',
           chunkFilename: 'static/js/[name].chunk.js',
         };
         webpackConfig.externals = ['react', 'react-dom']; // Externalize common dependencies
         return webpackConfig;
       },
     },
     devServer: {
       headers: {
         'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*', // Enable CORS for microfrontend
       },
     },
   };
   ```

2. **Modify the Entry Point** (e.g., `src/root-config.js`):

   This file will be used to export the lifecycle methods that Single-SPA will call.

   ```javascript
   import React from 'react';
   import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
   import singleSpaReact from 'single-spa-react';
   import App from './App';

   const lifecycles = singleSpaReact({
     React,
     ReactDOM,
     rootComponent: App,
     errorBoundary(err, info, props) {
       return <div>Error loading the micro-frontend!</div>;
     },
   });

   export const { bootstrap, mount, unmount } = lifecycles;
   ```

3. **Modify the `src/index.js`** to conditionally render your app for local development and export Single-SPA lifecycle methods:

   ```javascript
   import { bootstrap, mount, unmount } from './root-config';

   if (!window.singleSpaNavigate) {
     const rootElement = document.getElementById('root');
     ReactDOM.render(<App />, rootElement);
   }

   // Exporting lifecycle methods for Single-SPA
   export { bootstrap, mount, unmount };
   ```

### 2. **Building the Micro Frontend**

After configuring the micro frontend, build it:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command will generate the necessary static files that can be deployed to a server or a CDN.

### 3. **Deploy the Micro Frontend**

Upload the built files to a static file server or a CDN (like AWS S3, Netlify, etc.). Note the URL where the `main.js` or `app-name.js` file is hosted, as you’ll need it for the shell application.

### 4. **Import the Micro Frontend in the Shell Application**

In your shell application, you’ll register the micro frontend you just exposed.

#### Example: Registering the Micro Frontend in the Shell Application

1. **Install Required Packages**:

If you haven’t already set up Single-SPA in your shell application, you need to install it:

```bash
npm install single-spa single-spa-react
```

2. **Configure the Shell Application**:

In the root configuration file of your shell application (usually `src/index.js` or `src/root-config.js`), register the micro frontend.

```javascript
import { registerApplication, start } from 'single-spa';

// Register the micro frontend
registerApplication({
  name: '@org-name/micro-frontend-name', // Name of the micro frontend
  app: () => System.import('https://cdn.myapp.com/micro-frontend-name.js'), // URL of the micro frontend's JS file
  activeWhen: ['/'], // Adjust the route when this micro frontend should be active
});

// Start Single-SPA
start();
```

### 5. **Handling Shared Dependencies**

If you are using shared libraries (like React or ReactDOM), ensure they are externalized in both the micro frontend and the shell application. This way, the same instance is used across all micro frontends and the shell application.

- In the `webpack.config.js` of your micro frontend, ensure you specify:

```javascript
externals: ['react', 'react-dom'];
```

- In the shell application, do the same for consistency.

### 6. **Testing the Setup**

After everything is set up:

1. Run your shell application. If you're using `create-react-app`, you can run:

```bash
npm start
```

2. Navigate to the appropriate route to see if the micro frontend loads correctly.

### Conclusion

By following these steps, you will have successfully exposed a micro frontend and imported it into a shell application using Single-SPA. This setup allows for a scalable architecture where individual micro frontends can be developed, deployed, and updated independently while still functioning as part of a cohesive application.
